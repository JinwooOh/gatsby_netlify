### Who Are you?

Hi, I am Jinwoo. I live in Madison, Wisconsin and recently graduated the University of Wisconsin-Madison with Computer Science Major. Before I moved to the United States, I was living in Seoul, Korea and worked in a game industry for three years as a game designer. Becoming a game designer was my dream. People might ask me, "Why you quitted your dream job?" As a game designer, I had a power to convert my idea into some tangible materials such as slides and documents to communicate with others, but I couldnâ€™t make my own game or program without artists and programmers' help. And that makes me left Korea and seek out my other dream. I am currently looking for a full-time job opportunity as a software engineer. 

### Why Blog? 

I want to share technical knowledge that I learned from the school and myself, and also want to share my interest with people who have the same. 

Since English is not my first language, My writing is not perfect, and I mistake a lot. Hopefully writing some blogs helps me out and eventually improve my writing skill. 

### Interests

My blog topics will be: 

* Web Technology
* Algorithm 
* Data structure
* Boots (boots? Yes I love boots)
