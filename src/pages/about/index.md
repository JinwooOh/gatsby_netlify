### Who Are You
 
Hi, I am Jinwoo. I live in Madison, Wisconsin, and graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with Computer Science Major in 2018. Before I moved to the United States, I lived in Seoul, Korea, and worked in the game industry for three years as a game designer. Becoming a game designer was my dream. People might ask me, "Why you quitted your dream job?" As a game designer, I had a power to convert my idea into some tangible materials such as slides and documents to communicate with others, but I couldn't make my own game or program without artists and programmers' help. And that makes me left Korea and seek out my other dream. 

In 2018, I found that web development is an attractive profession. 
I like the fact that a web app is accessible to many people, and the web development field is constantly evolving, meaning I have to keep learning. 
 
### Why Blog
 
I want to share technical knowledge that I learned from the school and myself, and also want to share my interest with people who have the same.
 
Since English is not my first language, My writing is not perfect, and I mistake a lot. Hopefully writing some blogs helps me out and eventually improve my writing skill.
